What?
-----
Maven plugin to create a `.json` files with parsed `javap -l` output for each class file in your project.

Why?
----
Although this is part of a larger scheme, I'm not sure I'll ever get to that point. Till then, enjoy this partial code.

Production?
-----------
No, no real release has been done yet. The `javap` output parsing code still need to be written.
